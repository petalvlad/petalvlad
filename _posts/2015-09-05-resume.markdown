## About

iOS developer with over 3 years experience in creating iOS consumer facing applications. I specialize in building applications with strong architecture and implementing client-server integration between iOS application and backend API. You can find details of my architecture approach in the article [iOS Development as a Service](http://www.sm-cloud.com/ios-development-as-a-service/), and details of my client-server integration approach here [iOS Client-Server Integration Approach](http://www.sm-cloud.com/ios-client-server-integration-approach/). 

## Job Experience

### Smart Cloud 

August 2013 – Present, [http://smartcloud.io/](http://smartcloud.io/)

I have been working in this Сompany since August 2013 as an iOS developer. My primary work here is building iOS consumer facing applications.  I am engaged not only in the development work, but also communicate with clients in order to provide the best solution according to their requirements. Among that, I write technical articles which you can find on company’s [blog](http://www.sm-cloud.com/). 

Here are the projects I have worked on in Smart Cloud Company:

#### Polyfish

[http://www.polyfishapp.com/en/](http://www.polyfishapp.com/en/)

Polyfish is a video messaging and discovery app specially designed to help people from all over the world master new languages. This app allows users to choose a language they want to learn, find or create conversations with a specific topic and practice their speaking skills by recording and sending video messages.

My work on this project was to build messaging feature, implement recording and playback of video messages, implement friendship feature, and also implement sign in, sign up and user profile management features.

I have used following technologies and tools to achieve the project’s goals:

- `PubNub` for realtime messaging
- `AVFoundation` & `AVKit` for video recording and playback
- `Realm` as a local data storage
- `AFNetworking` & `Mantle` for handling networking and mapping JSON to models
- `ReactiveCocoa` as a glue between business logic layers and for data binding
- `FXForms` & `FXModelValidation` for managing static forms and validation
- MVVM pattern to encapsulate logic needed to prepare data for View layer
- `Typhoon` for objects dependencies management

Here is the demo video of how this app looks like and works

#### Flow Bottle

[http://flowlab.co/](http://flowlab.co/)

Flow Labs builds hardware and software ecosystems to help people create and maintain healthy hydration habits. My work on this project was to create a MVP iOS App which allows to: 

- Connect to Flow Bottle device via Bluetooth/BLE
- Read water consumptions data from device via Bluetooth/BLE
- Display water hydration progress (how much water has been consumed)
- Allow to add water inputs manually

<br>

#### Whitening Simulator Pro

[http://whiteningsimulatorpro.com/](http://whiteningsimulatorpro.com/)

The world’s first whitening simulator for dental websites and offices.

This is a complex product for dentists which consists of many parts. I have implemented following applications during this project: 

- Whitening Simulator iPad application - demo of how the app works is here [WS Pro demo video](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zf6nfry42o8cacs/wspro-demo.mov?dl=0)
- Whitening Simulator iPhone application - [App Store link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/whitening-simulator/id341030387?mt=8)  
- Whitening Simulator Javascript Web application which can be embedded into dentist's web site
- Analytics Panel - Ruby On Rails web analytics application for internal client's usage 
- Internal CMS which has been created for managing content of Whitening Simulator Pro iPad application - Ruby On Rails web application on top of RefineryCMS

#### EDMX

[http://edmx.net/](http://edmx.net/) 

iOS client application that helps EDM fans follow their favorite artists and plan festival trips.

My work on this project was to implement the following:

- News feature in the iOS application: browsing, searching, saving and favoriting news articles
- News sources parser – server background worker which periodically fetches news articles from different RSS news aggregators and saves them into EDMX database
- News Articles review panel, implemented using EmberJS and Ruby On Rails 

<br>

#### Veeb 

[http://veebproject.azurewebsites.net/](http://veebproject.azurewebsites.net/)

This is a full screen visual messaging app. My work on this project was to build an MVP iOS application.

<br>

### IT-Commune

February 2011 – September 2013, [http://it-commune.com/](http://it-commune.com/)

This was a good place to get technical skills working in pair with great developers, and also to evolve my remote working skills. Work for this company helped me to become familiar with many popular patterns of developing software, such as MVP and MVVM, and also learn frameworks and tools needed to build it. While working there I realized that I liked building consumer-facing applications most of all, and want to be involved into process of making decisions on what the end product should be like.
