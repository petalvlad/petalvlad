## About

Hello, I'm Alex, iOS developer with over 3 years experience in creating iOS consumer facing applications. I specialize on building applications with strong architecture and implementing client-server integration between an iOS application and backend API. You can find details of my architecture approach in this article http://www.sm-cloud.com/ios-development-as-a-service/, and also details of my client-server integration approach here http://www.sm-cloud.com/ios-client-server-integration-approach/.

## Job Experience

### Smart Cloud 

August 2013 – Present, [http://smartcloudcompany.com/](http://smartcloudcompany.com/)

I’ve been working in this company since august 2013 as an iOS developer. My primary work here is building iOS consumer facing applications. Except development work, I also communicate with clients in order to provide the best solution which corresponds to client's requirements. Also I write technical articles which you can find on company's blog http://www.sm-cloud.com/.

#### Polyfish

[http://www.polyfishapp.com/en/](http://www.polyfishapp.com/en/)

Polyfish is a video messaging and discovery app specially designed to help people everywhere master new languages, together. This app allows users to choose a language they want to learn, find or create conversations with specific topic and practice their speaking skills by recording and sending video messages. 

My work on this project was to build messaging feature, implement recording and playback of video messages, implement friendship feature, and also implement sign in, sign up and user profile management features. 

I've used following technologies and tools to achieve project's goals:

- `PubNub` for realtime messaging
- `AVFoundation` & `AVKit` for video recording and playback
- `Realm` as a local data storage
- `AFNetworking` & `Mantle` for handling networking and mapping JSON to models
- `ReactiveCocoa` as a glue between business logic layers and for data binding
- `FXForms` & `FXModelValidation` for managing static forms and validation
- MVVM pattern to encapsulate logic needed to prepare data for View layer
- `Typhoon` for objects dependencies management

Here is the demo video of how this app looks and works https://www.dropbox.com/s/px9ganbyjmqvnvq/demo.mov?dl=0

### IT-Commune

February 2011 – September 2013, [http://it-commune.com/](http://it-commune.com/)

This was a good place to get technical skills working in pair with great developers, and also to evolve my remote working skills. Work in this company helped me to became familiar with many popular patterns of developing software such as MVP and MVVM and also learn the frameworks and tools needed to build it. Working here I realized that I like to build consumer-facing applications the most and I want to be involved into the process of making decisions about the how the end product should be.
